Sequel to our reading group on "Commutative algebra with a view towards algebraic geometry" by David Eisenbud, this is a reading group on algebraic geometry following ["The Rising Sea"](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf) by Ravi Vakil. No longer are we content with just "a view towards algebraic geometry" - we are diving in head-first!

We meet every Friday at 2PM in whichever venue is closest to Hodge Club. Hybrid participation is also possible - please get in touch at Malthe (dot) Sporring (at) ed.ac.uk to be added to the mailing list.

The reading group is organized joint with [Willow Bevington](https://capnjackbevs.github.io/).
