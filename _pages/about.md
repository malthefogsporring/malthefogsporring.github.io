I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Professor Clark Barwick. I am interested in homotopy theory and related areas: algebraic topology, (higher) category theory, stratified and chromatic homotopy theory. I am also interested in mathematical education, and have experience in technology-assisted education via the [online assessment system STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/).

### Notes
The following are informal notes on various topics. Comments and corrections are more than welcome.
* [**axiomatic homology**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malthefogsporring/homology/main/main.pdf) - Undergraduate notes on axiomatic homology theory. Typically, homology theory is introduced as singular homology, and core results are proven very explicitly via chain calculations. In these notes we explore a different approach: we define a homology theory axiomatically as by Eilenberg and Steenrod, and then prove theorems directly from these axioms. For example, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence shows up as a consequence of just excision and exact sequences in relative homology - no singular chains needed. In fact, ordinary homology theories with a choice of coefficients are unique, so their properties should not depend on the specific way a particular theory is constructed. This project was supervised by Prof. Clark Barwick and funded by the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics Vacation Scholarship and College Vacation Scholarship funds.

### Reading groups
* (Sep 2022-current) **Commutative Algebra**. A reading group on "Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry" by David Eisenbud.

### STACK
STACK is an open source online assessment system for STEM subjects. It is designed to automate undergraduate level formative and summative assessment in a clever way. In particular, it puts very few limits on the sorts of questions that can be asked and has flexibility for giving useful feedback tailored to each student's answers. It is also designed to be fair on students and in particular students are not penalised for poor computer syntax. For more information on STACK, see [stack-assessment.org](https://stack-assessment.org/). I have been involved in STACK since 2019, here are some highlights of my contributions:
* Designing the STACK website.
* Editing [a collection of case studies](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/2019-cate-case-studies.pdf) for STACK.
* Developing a [video tutorial series](http://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Authoring/Authoring_quick_start/) for STACK.

I will happily answer questions about STACK, see my contact info.
