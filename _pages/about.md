I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Professor Clark Barwick. I am interested in homotopy theory and related areas: algebraic topology, (higher) category theory, stratified and chromatic homotopy theory. I am also interested in mathematical education and I am an experienced user of the online assessment system [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/). When I'm not thinking about mathematics I like to hike and swing dance.

## Notes
The following are informal notes on various topics. Comments and corrections are more than welcome.

### [![pdf](../images/pdf.png) **Axiomatic homology**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malthefogsporring/homology/main/main.pdf) 
Undergraduate notes on axiomatic homology theory. Homology is typically introduced as singular homology, and theorems are then proven explicitly using chain calculations. We take a different approach, defining a homology theory axiomatically as by Eilenberg and Steenrod, and then prove classical theorems directly from the axioms. This project was supervised by Prof. Clark Barwick and funded by the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics Vacation Scholarship and College Vacation Scholarship funds.

## Reading groups
* (2022) **Commutative Algebra**. A reading group on commutative algebra, following the book by David Eisenbud.

## STACK
STACK is an open source online assessment system for STEM subjects. For more information on STACK, see [stack-assessment.org](https://stack-assessment.org/). I have been involved in STACK since 2019 - here are some of my contributions:
* Designing the [STACK website](https://stack-assessment.org/).
* Editing [a collection of case studies](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/2019-cate-case-studies.pdf).
* Developing a [video tutorial series](http://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Authoring/Authoring_quick_start/).

I will happily answer questions about STACK, see my contact info.
